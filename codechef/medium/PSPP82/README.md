## Problem

### Calling a function within function

Listen

Functions can also call other functions in Python.

Check the sample code given below

```
# Function to calculate the square of a number
def square(num):
    return num * num

def square_and_double(num):
    # Call the square function to calculate square
    squared = square(num)

    # Double the squared result
    return 2 * squared

# Call the square_and_double function with the argument 3
result = square_and_double(3)

print("Result:", result)     # Output will be 'Result: 18'

```

### Task
- The editor contains an incomplete code.
- Update the function greet_and_capitalize by calling the above defined functions inside it to get the expected output.

 **Expected output** 

```
Final Result: HELLO, ALICE!

```
