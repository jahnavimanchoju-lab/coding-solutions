## Problem

### Count of Digits

Listen

Chef's coding journey continues.
Chef was given an integer input $N$ - he needs to find the number of digits in the given integer.

- Let's assume the number of digits in $N$ is $x$.
- Whenever we divide a number by $10$ and store it in an integer, the right-most digit of that number gets removed.
- Since $1$ digit gets removed each time we divide a number by $10$, thus the total number digits we can remove from a number are the total number of digits in the number.
- Thus, we can divide $N$ by $10$, $x$ times before it becomes $0$, after which the division will not affect the number and it will remain $0$(as $0$ divided by anything is still $0$).
- So, If we keep dividing the integer $N$ by $10$ in a loop, till it reaches $0$, the loop will execute $x$ times.
- Now, we can just count how many times the loop was executed, by starting a count from $0$ and increasing the count each time the loop executes.
- Here, we can get the number of digits in $N$ in count.

Based on this, Help him complete the `while` loop.

```py
num = int(input())
count = 0

while num != 0:
    # Update your code below this line
    
    num=num//10
    count=count+1
    
    

print(count)
```
